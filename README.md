### Planned Enhancements

* Reformating divs so that the display of fewer than 24 is cleaner looking
* when flowers are matched, a short message about the genus of the flower and where and when it grows
* differing time amounts allowed for different board sizes
* leaderboard for shortest time making all matches based on board size
